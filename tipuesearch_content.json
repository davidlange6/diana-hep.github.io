Cincinnati The Department of Physics at the University of Cincinnati is currently seeking qualified applicants for the position of Sr. Research Associate or Research Scientist (title to be finalized following review of applicants' backgrounds, experience and qualifications). Candidates should have significant software development experience, and preferably expertise in flavor physics. The job responsibilities fall into two categories: (i) helping develop state-of-the-art software tools for high energy physics (and other data-intensive) experiments as part of the the NSF-funded DIANA/HEP project and (ii) working as a member of the LHCb collaboration at CERN. The work on LHCb will have two components: service work as part of the core computing group and data analysis. The details of all assignments will be determined by negotiation between the individual hired and the grant Principal Investigator (Dr. Michael Sokoloff). All applications received by August 14, 2015 will receive full consideration. PLEASE NOTE : This position is based in Geneva, Switzerland to facilitate working at CERN. Interested and qualified applicants must complete an online application and submit a curriculm vitae/resume by visiting this link (or go to http://www.uc.edu/hr/toolkits/opportunities.html and search for Requisition #5586). For additional information, please send e-mail to mike.sokoloff@uc.edu . Applications will be reviewed and considered as they are received. The University of Cincinnati is an Affirmative Action / Equal Opportunity Employer / M / F / Vet / Disabled. Nebraska Coming soon. NYU An opening for a full-time Postdoctoral Researcher has arisen in association to the DIANA/HEP project. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP is to develop state-of-the-art tools for experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to ROOT and other packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. This position would report to Prof. Kyle Cranmer with the experimental particle physics group at New York University and may receive the honorary title of \"Research Engineer\" through the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment at NYU . The focus of this position is on improving interoperability with the scientific python ecosystem and development of collaborative tools. The successful candidate will also be able to devote a significant fraction of their time to their own research program within the ATLAS experiment. We seek applicants both from a traditional HEP background with a strong software focus as well as applicants from the machine learning and data science communities that are interested in HEP research topics. The position can be based either at NYU or at CERN. The postdoc can benefit from the lively atmosphere of the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics (CCPP) as well as the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment at NYU . Further information on the experimental particle physics group at NYU may be found at http://physics.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/ Applications must be submitted via the CCPP Online Application System (please select \"DIANA\" in your research interests). Complete applications must include a CV, publication list, statement of research interests, and a list of three people who will be submitting letters of recommendation. The position is available immediately and applications will be considered until the position is filled. Apply Online (please select \"DIANA\" in the Research Interests): http://cosmo.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/app_register.html?&ptitle=pdoc Check your Application Status : http://cosmo.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/app_status.html For further questions about the position, please contact Kyle.Cranmer@nyu.edu. NYU is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer, and encourages applications from women and members of minority groups. Princeton Associate Professional Specialists(s)/Professional Specialist(s) Computational Physicist and/or Scientific Application Developer Position Summary: Princeton University is seeking two Professional Specialists to work with the High Energy Experiment group in the Physics Department. High Energy Physics (HEP) focuses on understanding the elementary particles that are the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions. Obtaining scientific results from these high energy physics experiments requires complex software and computing systems, developed by international teams of researchers over the course of decades. The scientific data sets obtained by these experiments are among the largest in the world. Successful candidates will play a leadership role in developing the software and computing systems to meet the challenges of high energy physics experiments. Successful candidates will be members of the DIANA/HEP project team (http://diana-hep.org) and the CMS experiment (http://cms.web.cern.ch) at the Large Hadron Collider at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. The DIANA/HEP project aims to develop state-of-the-art data analysis tools for experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. DIANA/HEP focuses on improving performance, increasing interoperability between HEP software tools and the scientific python software ecosystem and on the development of collaborative tools. The CMS experiment, one of two general purpose detectors at the LHC, is currently investigating upgrades to its computing system to support an ambitious research plan extending through the 2020's. Applicants from multiple backgrounds are encouraged to apply. Candidates from both a traditional HEP background (and a strong software focus) as well as those from the machine learning, data science and/or scientific python communities (with an interest in HEP research topics) will be considered. The position(s) will have a functional title of \"Computational Physicist\" or \"Scientific Application Developer\" depending on the specific background of the successful candidate(s). Appointments will be made at either the Associate Professional Specialist or Professional Specialist rank, depending on the candidate's credentials. These positions will likely be based at CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland, or at Fermilab, near Chicago, subject to negotiation with the principal investigator. Occasional travel to conferences and workshops will be required. The initial appointment will be for one year, with the possibility of renewal subject to satisfactory performance and availability of funding. For additional information, please contact Dr. Peter Elmer (Peter.Elmer@cern.ch). Essential Qualifications: * Academic preparation: * Ph.D. in Experimental Particle Physics or a closely related field, or * Advanced degree in Computer Science with 5 years or more experience with scientific software applications * Strong programming skills, in particular with C++ and Python * Experience developing large-scale scientific software applications, in particular involving or contributing to one or more of the following: * Analysis of large datasets * Open source machine learning or data mining software toolkits, and/or the scientific python ecosystem * Monte Carlo detector simulations * Pattern recognition techniques relevant for high energy and nuclear physics detectors * Strong interpersonal, oral, and written communication skills. Preferred Qualifications: * Ability to direct efforts of others within teams of various sizes * Experience working in large, international scientific or open-source software collaborations and delivering software in such contexts To apply online please visit http://physics.princeton.edu/jobs and submit a cover letter, CV and contact information for three references.
