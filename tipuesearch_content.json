The primary goal of DIANA/HEP is to develop state-of-the-art tools for experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to ROOT and other packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. As part of the NSF's Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) program, DIANA is concerned with the overarching goal of transforming innovations in research and education into sustained software resources that are an integral part of the cyberinfrastructure.

Focus Areas increase the CPU and IO performance needed to reduce the iteration time so crucial to exploring new ideas, develop software to effectively exploit emerging many- and multi-core hardware, establish infrastructure for a higher-level of collaborative analysis, building on the successful patterns used for the Higgs boson discovery and enabling a deeper communication between the theoretical community and the experimental community, streamline efforts associated to reproducibility, analysis preservation, and data preservation by making these native concepts in the tools, promote the concept of software as a research product, improve the interoperability of HEP tools with the larger scientific software ecosystem, incorporating best practices and algorithms from other disciplines into HEP, and provide training for students in these techniques. We will make our tools, computing insights, and approaches to collaborative analysis available to the larger scientific community.
