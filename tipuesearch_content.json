The primary goal of DIANA/HEP is to develop state-of-the-art tools for experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to ROOT and other packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. As part of the NSF's Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) program, DIANA is concerned with the overarching goal of transforming innovations in research and education into sustained software resources that are an integral part of the cyberinfrastructure.

Cincinnati The Department of Physics at the University of Cincinnati is currently seeking qualified applicants for the position of Sr. Research Associate or Research Scientist (title to be finalized following review of applicants' backgrounds, experience and qualifications). Candidates should have significant software development experience, and preferably expertise in flavor physics. The job responsibilities fall into two categories: (i) helping develop state-of-the-art software tools for high energy physics (and other data-intensive) experiments as part of the the NSF-funded DIANA/HEP project and (ii) working as a member of the LHCb collaboration at CERN. The work on LHCb will have two components: service work as part of the core computing group and data analysis. The details of all assignments will be determined by negotiation between the individual hired and the grant Principal Investigator (Dr. Michael Sokoloff). All applications received by August 14, 2015 will receive full consideration. PLEASE NOTE : This position is based in Geneva, Switzerland to facilitate working at CERN. Interested and qualified applicants must complete an online application and submit a curriculm vitae/resume by visiting http://www.uc.edu/hr/toolkits/opportunities.html and then searching for Requisition #5586. For additional information, please send e-mail to mike.sokoloff@uc.edu . Applications will be reviewed and considered as they are received. The University of Cincinnati is an Affirmative Action / Equal Opportunity Employer / M / F / Vet / Disabled. Nebraska Coming soon. NYU An opening for a full-time Postdoctoral Researcher has arisen in association to the DIANA/HEP project. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP is to develop state-of-the-art tools for experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to ROOT and other packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. This position would report to Prof. Kyle Cranmer with the experimental particle physics group at New York University and may receive the honorary title of \"Research Engineer\" through the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment at NYU . The focus of this position is on improving interoperability with the scientific python ecosystem and development of collaborative tools. The successful candidate will also be able to devote a significant fraction of their time to their own research program within the ATLAS experiment. We seek applicants both from a traditional HEP background with a strong software focus as well as applicants from the machine learning and data science communities that are interested in HEP research topics. The position can be based either at NYU or at CERN. The postdoc can benefit from the lively atmosphere of the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics (CCPP) as well as the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment at NYU . Further information on the experimental particle physics group at NYU may be found at http://physics.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/ Applications must be submitted via the CCPP Online Application System (please select \"DIANA\" in your research interests). Complete applications must include a CV, publication list, statement of research interests, and a list of three people who will be submitting letters of recommendation. The position is available immediately and applications will be considered until the position is filled. Apply Online (please select \"DIANA\" in the Research Interests): http://cosmo.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/app_register.html?&ptitle=pdoc Check your Application Status : http://cosmo.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/app_status.html For further questions about the position, please contact Kyle.Cranmer@nyu.edu. NYU is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer, and encourages applications from women and members of minority groups.
