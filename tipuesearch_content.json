{"pages":[{"url":"/pages/about.html.html","text":"Advanced software plays a fundamental role in large scientific projects. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP is to develop state-of-the-art tools for experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to ROOT and other packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. As part of the NSF's Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) program, DIANA is concerned with the overarching goal of transforming innovations in research and education into sustained software resources that are an integral part of the cyberinfrastructure.
